# 🔥 Ouch! AI
An AI that brutally roasts you, no matter what you say.

> [!NOTE]
> We do not condone the use of AI. We made Ouch! AI for entertainment purposes **ONLY** in literally only 2 hours. Ouch! AI will never have image generation or any harmful features that some AIs (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) ship with.

## 📝 Note
Katniny Studios will **NEVER** make an actual AI chatbot or integrate Ouch! AI into any other product, such as Luma (fka Meowser), as we do not believe in heavy use of AI as some companies (e.g. Google, Microsoft) might.

## 🧑‍💻 Try it yourself
If you think you can make Ouch! AI better, feel free to open any pull requests!
We ask that:
* You do not use AI generated code or speech (ironic, I know, but please!)
* Create features that actually harm others (e.g. AI image generation)

We use Webpack and Node modules.
To start, you will need Node 20 or higher installed, we also highly recommend Git.

Once you have Node, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/katniny/ouchai .` in an empty directory

Then, in that same terminal, navigate to the directory if needed and run `npm install` to install all of Ouch! AI's dependencies.

Ouch! AI requires an API key from [EdenAI](https://www.edenai.co/). You will need an account, however you do not need a credit card to get started.

Once you get an API key, navigate to .env_example and rename it to just .env

Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you acquired.

Now, run `npm start` and Ouch! AI will start running!
